    "1. A medium shot, with the camera slowly dollying forward in a dimly lit, grand Parisian archive. Dust motes dance in a single beam of light from a high window. Clara, a historian in her early 30s, with observant, dark brown eyes that hold a quiet intensity. She has chin-length, black hair styled in a classic bob. She is dressed in a sophisticated, dark navy-blue wool coat, with a silk scarf patterned with subtle gold and cream designs tied around her neck. She stands before a large, ancient wooden table, carefully turning the fragile, yellowed page of a massive, leather-bound book. Her expression is one of deep concentration. In a voice that is crisp and clear, with a thoughtful, analytical tone and a standard american accent, Clara says: It has to be here",
    "2. A wide shot of the Pont des Arts in Paris at twilight, the sky a mix of deep blue and soft orange. The lights of the city are beginning to twinkle on along the Seine. Clara, a historian in her early 30s, with observant, dark brown eyes that hold a quiet intensity. She has chin-length, black hair styled in a classic bob. She is dressed in a sophisticated, dark navy-blue wool coat, with a silk scarf patterned with subtle gold and cream designs tied around her neck. She leans against the railing, looking out at the water, a small, triumphant smile on her face. She pulls a folded, old map from her coat pocket and looks down at it. In a voice that is crisp and clear, with a thoughtful, analytical tone and a standard american accent, Clara says: I knew it. The path starts from here",
    "3. An eye-level shot in a small, hidden Parisian courtyard, overgrown with ivy and lit by a single, warm gas lamp. Clara, a historian in her early 30s, with observant, dark brown eyes that hold a quiet intensity. She has chin-length, black hair styled in a classic bob. She is dressed in a sophisticated, dark navy-blue wool coat, with a silk scarf patterned with subtle gold and cream designs tied around her neck. She kneels down and runs her fingers over an ancient, carved symbol on a stone paver, almost completely obscured by moss. Her eyes light up with discovery. In a voice that is crisp and clear, with a thoughtful, analytical tone and a standard american accent, Clara says: After all these years, I've found it",
